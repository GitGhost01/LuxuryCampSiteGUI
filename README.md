# LuxuryCampSiteGUI
Used Java with JavaFX to build a multi-featured application for a degree-level assignment which is nearly 800 lines of code long. Allows the user (i.e. the owner) to switch between four different areas of the site, check customers in/out and update a table to show which rooms are occupied, available and need cleaning. It also validates rooms to meet certain requirements before customers can be checked into them.
