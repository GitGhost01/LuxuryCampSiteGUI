# Luxury Camp Site Management System

## A Java-based application built in order to help the user (i.e. the owner of the site) to easily manage the occupation status of various accomodations between 4 different sites

This is a degree (second-year) Software Engineering assignment built adhering to a specification which is specified in the document. As it is a lengthy document, screenshots of the specification I will leave at the bottom of this README file. The program allows the user to switch between four different areas of the site, check customers in/out and update a table to show which rooms are occupied, available and need cleaning. It also validates rooms to meet certain requirements before customers can be checked into them.

Also utilised JavaFX for this project as it is a more modern Java framework opposed to Java AWT or Swing and in combination with Scene Builder allowed me to create a visually-appealing GUI.

#### Exmaple of validation when all requirements of check-in aren't met (names containing only letters, mobile numbers being only numbers and 11 digits long etc.)
